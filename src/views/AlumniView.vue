            <p>Alumni (plural of alumnus) refer to an association of people who previously attended or graduated from a particular school, college or university, or people who had a former association with the same organization.</p>
            <p>The purpose of an association is to foster a spirit of loyalty and to promote the general welfare of one's organization. Alumni associations exist to support the parent organization's goals, and to strengthen the ties between alumni, the community, and the parent organization. By registering or being a member of the alumni therefore is a beautiful way of saying "thank you" to one's parent organization and manifesting earnest sense of belonging.</p>
